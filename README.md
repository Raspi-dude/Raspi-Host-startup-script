This is the script used at startup for all BeamMP servers hosted on Raspi Host, which is my free Beam MP server hosting project. Check it out at https://host.raspidude.eu.org. 

So far this script will do the following: 
1. Show the Raspi Host banner
2. Print out a random MOTD
3. Enforce TOS
4. Re-download the Beam MP binary to help prevent abusers who replace the real binary with their own scripts to run their own code (supports x86 and ARM)

I have uploaded this script to be more transparent with my operation of Raspi Host, but you are welcome to use it privately for your own needs without permission. If you want to use this for commercial purposes, contact me on Discord at @raspi_dude.
