This is the script used at startup for all BeamMP servers hosted on Raspi Host, which is my free Beam MP server hosting project. Check it out at https://raspihost.org. 

So far this script will do the following: 
1. Show the Raspi Host banner
2. Print out a random MOTD
3. Enforce TOS
4. Re-download the Beam MP binary to help prevent abusers who replace the real binary with their own scripts to run their own code (supports x86 and ARM)

I have uploaded this script to be more transparent with my operation of Raspi Host, but you are welcome to use it privately or commercially without permission. I would really like to know if this script has helped someone out, so please either leave a star or tell me about it on discord at @raspi_dude :D
